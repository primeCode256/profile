            <p class="code-clear-ppt">I started Coding in my Sophomor years in the University because I needed to know how it feels to code my own a website and got a feel of it
             Since then, I have gained a wealth of experience Designing websites for Clients. and also designed some web games.

            <h3>Typing</h3>
            <p class="code-clear-ppt">Typing became an interesting skill for me the moment I could lay hold on a personal computer. Laptop to be presice. During my 
              high school days, I was literally scared of touching a computer especially the mouse. But as I got my own personal computer, I came 
              to find out that neither the computer nor the mouse bites. They are just my friends ever ready for my usage. Since then. I developed a
              liking for the keybord and the mouse. I became a professional typist doing typing jobs for clients etc
